        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>

            The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers Master of Fine Arts Degrees in Graphic Design,
            Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture
            <br/><br/>
            Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided an educational context in which
            they can explore the potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical dialogue. This
            dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by a faculty comprised of professional
            artists of acknowledged accomplishment.
            <br/><br/>
            The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own studio
            activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous,
            structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich academic offerings
            found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters with
            faculty members and visitors. The School is devoted not only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to
            the cultivation of the mind. Students must bring creative force and imagination to their own development,
            for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be stimulated and appreciated.
            <br/><br/>
            The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale College (see the bulletin Yale
            College Programs of Study). In addition, the School’s courses are open to students in the Graduate School of
            Arts and Sciences and other professional schools of the University, and School of Art students may enroll in
            elective courses in the Graduate School and other professional schools as well as in the College with
            permission.

                    and loans do not meet a student’s full financial need, scholarship funds are awarded.
                    Scholarships are also known as grant or gift aid and, unlike loans, do not have to be repaid. If
                    your financial aid applications are received and processed by the School’s deadline and you have
                    calculated need, the School makes every effort to award a substantial scholarship to you.
                    Scholarship availability is based on the number of students with calculated financial need
                    within the School and the amount of funds available.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Scholarship is need-based and only awarded to accepted students who’ve applied for aid and have
                    demonstrated need. The maximum scholarship for first-year students does not exceed tuition
                    costs.

                    A portion of your financial need will be met with an offer of a unit loan. Your loan offer is
                    composed of loans from either the Federal Direct Loan Programs if you are a U.S. Citizen/Permanent
                    Resident or an alternative/private bank/Yale International Student loan if you do not qualify for
                    the federal loan programs or you are an International Student. You must indicate the type and amount
                    of the loan you would like to borrow, if you choose to borrow, on the Art Loan Form 2019-20.
                    <br/><br/>
                    (Domestic Students) Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Program - The Direct Unsubsidized Loan is a
                    federal loan with an annual limit of $20,500. Interest charges accrue during enrollment. Students
                    may borrow an amount up to the cost of attendance minus any financial aid. The fixed interest rate
                    for the current/upcoming academic year for all borrowers is 6.6% with a 1.062% fee. The new rate for
                    beyond October 1st, 2019 has not yet been determined. The cumulative amount of Direct Loans borrowed
                    (undergraduate and graduate) may not exceed $138,500. This loan may be used to replace the student
                    and parent contributions. Interest may be paid monthly, or it may be accrued and added to the
                    principal (capitalized) when the student graduates or the deferment period ends. Repayment will
                    begin six months (grace period) after the student has left school. Following the six-month grace
                    period, loan repayment usually occurs within the ten-year period after graduation, but longer
                    repayment options may be available, not counting approved deferments or loan consolidation. You may
                    repay part or all your loans in advance without penalty. If you are currently in repayment for an
                    undergraduate loan, further repayment may be deferred once you enroll at Yale. It is the student’s
                    responsibility to communicate with the lender or holder of the prior loans to receive a deferment.
                    <br/><br/>
                    (Domestic Students) Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan - Credit–worthy Graduate students may borrow a
                    loan in an amount up to the cost of attendance less any other financial aid offered. The terms and
                    conditions include: a requirement that the applicant not have an adverse credit history; a repayment
                    period that begins on the date of the last disbursement of the loan; and a fixed interest rate of
                    7.6% with a 4.248% fee (for the current/future academic year). The new rate for beyond October 1st,
                    2019 has not yet been determined. This is a federal loan which can be consolidated with other
                    federal loan programs after graduation.
                    <br/><br/>
                    (Domestic Students) Federal Direct Loan Application Process - Yale University participates
                    exclusively in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program. Borrowers will obtain loan funds
                    directly from the U.S. Department of Education. This program offers students a more streamlined,
                    stable and predictable borrowing experience. The financial aid award letter you received includes a
                    detailed breakdown of your loan offer. Your first responsibility is to review that offer carefully
                    and to contact us with any questions you have about any of the listed loan programs. When you have
                    decided to accept or decline our loan offer, please sign and return the Art Loan Form 2019-20. The
                    Yale School of Art Financial Aid Office will electronically set up and certify your Federal Direct
                    loan(s) once we have completed the federal verification process (see Verification of Awards section)
                    and/or have received the items listed on the Financial Aid Verification Checklist. After your loan
                    has been accepted by the Department of Education, you will receive an e-mail directing you to the
                    Student Loans website to complete the online Master Promissory Note (MPN) and Entrance Loan
                    Counseling. You will need your Federal FSA ID number to complete the MPN. If you intend to borrow
                    from both the Direct Unsubsidized Loan and Direct Grad Plus Loan programs, you will need to complete
                    a separate MPN for each loan program.
                    <br/><br/>
                    (Domestic Students) For the Direct Grad PLUS Loan a credit check is required. By signing the Loan
                    Notification/ Confirmation Form you are authorizing the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) to
                    investigate your credit record. Instructions for completing the Direct Grad Plus Loan MPN will be
                    emailed to you once your credit has been approved.
                    <br/><br/>
                    (Domestic/International Students) Alternative/Private Bank Loans - Alternative/Private bank loans
                    are available to students who do not qualify for the federal programs, cannot cover their full cost
                    of attendance with federal loans, and for International Students. Students need to complete the Art
                    Loan Form 2019-20 and return it to the Financial Aid Office. Yale has identified alternative loan
                    lenders that our students have borrowed from in the recent past and who are providing alternative
                    loans for educational purposes. Review the Yale website on student loans for professional/graduate
                    students for more information. The website has a link to ELMSelect for a comparison of the different
                    lenders that you can evaluate, selecting a lender that best fits your loan needs. Call the Financial
                    Aid Office if you have any questions.
                    <br/><br/>
                    (Domestic/International Students) Alternative/Private Bank Loan Application Process - The students
                    must apply for an alternative loan directly from the lenders. The lenders will contact Yale and the
                    two parties will work together to issue your loan funds through the University. You are free to
                    choose any lender and we will process a loan for you from any lender provided you have the unmet
                    need to accommodate your loan request.
                    <br/><br/>
                    (International Students) Yale International Student Loan Program - Yale University offers a loan
                    program to full time International Students. The loan is available to students who do not have a
                    U.S. co-signer which prevents them from qualifying for an alternative/bank loan. There is a 5%
                    origination fee. The 2019-2020 interest rate will be announced in the spring; the current fixed rate
                    is 7.75%. The loan will have a 6-month grace period and a 10-year repayment period. Interest accrues
                    during attendance and is capitalized at the end of the grace period. There is no formal application
                    for this loan.
                    <br/><br/>

                    Work-study as part of your financial aid award indicates eligibility for a job within Yale. There
                    are a number of jobs within the School of Art (admissions, labs, studio crews, etc.) that paid
                    $14.25 per hour in 2019-20. If you are awarded a job within the School, you will be notified by the
                    supervisor. Generally, it will involve four-to-six hours a week during the regular academic year
                    only.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Work-study positions available within the School of Art may be limited and not all MFA students
                    necessarily will be assigned a job within the School. So it is suggested you examine the Yale

                    <b>(Returning/Second-year students ONLY)</b><br/><br/>
                    School of Art faculty select Teaching Assistants each year from the second-year class. Pay is a flat
                    rate for the term and is determined by the class’s number of hours and sections. At the time they
                    are assigned, Teaching Assistantships are not determined through financial need; however, the amount
                    a student earns is considered a term-time earning and may reduce a student’s total need insofar as
                    the financial award is concerned. Teaching Assistants normally receive an appointment for one term.

                    be aware of. When possible, the page also identifies specifics, such as how each department chooses
                    to nominate individuals, and the particular qualifications or requirements necessary for each
                    opportunity.

                    <b>Student Grants & Fellowships at Yale</b>Yale offers a searchable database of grants currently
                    available. If you are a new American and under 31 years of age, you might consider
                    applying for the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. Please note that any outside
                    grants, fellowships or scholarships are considered financial resources and would reduce any awarded
                    Yale scholarship dollar-for-dollar.
