# Red Line, Phase 0: "guerrilla"

- repository : `social-impact-clientname`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation Challenge`
- Duration : `six hours`
- Deployment strategy : Github page
	
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Learning objectives

- Find out how to quickly build a one-page website using pre-existing templates. Guerilla style.
- Discover and use the Lighthouse Test and the W3C Validator, great tools to improve your coding knowledge and your frontend skills
- Put your new skills to use in a real-life scenario
- Get used to the notion of [satisficing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) as an alternative to perfectionism.

## Scenario
You work in the E-Marketing department of a local web agency. The PM ("Project Manager") comes rushing into your office while you were quietly sipping your Cinnamon coffee, browsing your Twitter account. 

> "We have an emergency : only you can save us !"

You reply :
> "Me? Why me ?"

The PM: 
> "Because LuÃ¬s is sick, Marie-Ange was debauched by Emakina, and I don't understand anything about the web: I'm just a PM, after all!  
> But hey, listen: the customer is a good client. We don't want to disappoint them.
> The problem is that they have a very important event tomorrow and they just realized that their digital presence is crap. Do what you can to improve this so that by tomorrow they have a one-pager that is better than what they have today."

You: 
> "All right, all right. I'll take care of it. Anyway, I was bored."

## Your Mission 

Your coach assigns you to a project.
You can find your project [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fn2cPgNM7zq9FQvYEzyfR93IofGdAxwf52xLJhGCuxg/edit?usp=sharing). If you don't have an entry, you have to choose a project of another learner. Inform your coach of your choice!
Create and deploy before 4PM a *one-pager* that looks and communicate better than their current site, and is responsive.   
Given the short deadline, a good strategy would be to use and tweak a template (pick one here : [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/)).

You have to use sass! Bootstrap is optional.

## The specifics
- Hosting via a GitHub Page
- Use the content on their existing website to create a better one. If they don't have one, gather content based on what you can find on the web. Mac Gyver style. You don't have to use all of their content, summarize it by focusing on what's really important to understand who they are, and what they do.
- Pick a template on [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/) (easy) or design your own (more challenging!)
- Tweak the template to adapt it to the content
- Once published, you are not done.  Use the [Lighthouse Test](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) and improve the score as much as you can for each category.
- Be sure to have a good readme file with a link to the "website" on github.
- Finished? Send your work to the coach using the dedicated spreadsheet.

Good luck, soldier.
